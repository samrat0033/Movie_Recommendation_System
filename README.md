# Movie Recommendation System Project


This repository contains the implementation of a Movie Recommendation System using a movie dataset. The system leverages Machine Learning techniques to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences.


## Project Overview


The Movie Recommendation System aims to predict the likelihood that a user will enjoy a movie. By analyzing the user's past movie-watching history and the properties of the movies, the system will generate a list of recommended films. The model uses a movie dataset that includes features such as genre, director, cast, plot keywords, ratings, and more.


## Objectives


The primary objectives of this Movie Recommendation System project are as follows:


- **User Personalization**: To create a personalized experience for users by recommending films based on their individual tastes and viewing habits.


- **Feature Utilization**: To effectively use the features available in the movie dataset, such as genre, director, and user ratings, to inform the recommendation algorithms.


- **Model Accuracy**: To develop a Machine Learning model that accurately predicts user preferences, aiming for high precision and recall in the recommendations.


- **Scalability**: To ensure the system can handle a large number of users and movies without a decline in performance.


- **User Engagement**: To increase user engagement by providing relevant movie recommendations that encourage further interaction with the service.


- **Algorithm Diversity**: To explore and implement different recommendation algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness for this specific application.


- **Data Analysis**: To perform comprehensive data analysis to understand user behavior and movie popularity, which in turn can improve the recommendation engine.


- **Continuous Learning**: To implement a system that learns over time, improving its recommendations as it gains more data on user preferences.


## Technologies and Tools Used


- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub


## Installation and Setup


To set up this project locally, follow these steps:


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```


2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```


4. Open `Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb` to get started.


## Data Preprocessing


This section outlines the steps taken to preprocess the movie dataset for modeling:


- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data (e.g., extracting year from release dates, combining cast and director information).
- **Normalization**: Scaling numeric features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical data (e.g., genres, directors) into numerical format for model compatibility.


## Modeling Techniques


The following machine learning techniques were explored in this project:


- **Collaborative Filtering**: Using user-movie interaction data to find similar users and recommend movies based on their preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommending movies similar to those a user has liked in the past, based on movie attributes like genre, director, and cast.
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combining collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Neural Networks**: Implementing deep learning models for more complex and accurate recommendations.


## Evaluation Metrics


The performance of the recommendation system was evaluated using the following metrics:


- **Precision**: The proportion of recommended movies that the user actually likes.
- **Recall**: The proportion of movies liked by the user that were successfully recommended.
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: Evaluating the ranking of recommended movies.


## Challenges and Solutions


During the development of this project, the following challenges were encountered and addressed:


- **Data Sparsity**: Implementing techniques like matrix factorization to handle sparse user-movie interaction matrices.
- **Cold Start Problem**: Creating strategies for recommending movies to new users or for newly added movies with little or no data.
- **Scalability**: Optimizing the recommendation algorithms and data storage to ensure the system can scale with increasing users and movies.


## Future Work


Potential improvements and future directions for this project include:


- **Enhanced User Profiles**: Incorporating more user data (e.g., reviews, watch history across platforms) for better personalization.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Implementing a system that updates recommendations in real-time as user preferences evolve.
- **Incorporating External Data**: Using data from social media, news, or trends to inform recommendations.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Continuously refining and testing new algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.


## Sample Output


Below are examples of movie recommendations generated by the system:


- **User 1**: Based on the user's love for action movies, the system recommended *Mad Max: Fury Road*, *John Wick*, and *The Dark Knight*.
- **User 2**: For a user with a preference for romantic comedies, the system suggested *Crazy Rich Asians*, *La La Land*, and *Notting Hill*.
